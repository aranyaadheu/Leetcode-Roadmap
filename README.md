Basics and Warm-Up
- Big O Notation & Time Complexity

Arrays
- Single Pass Problems (e.g., Two Sum, Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock)
- Sliding Window (e.g., Maximum Subarray, Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters)
- Prefix Sum (e.g., Subarray Sum Equals K)

Strings
  - Basic String Manipulation (e.g., Reverse String, Valid Palindrome)
  - Hashing with Strings (e.g., Group Anagrams, Longest Palindrome)

Intermediate Data Structures
- Linked Lists
  - Basic Operations (e.g., Merge Two Sorted Lists, Remove Nth Node From End)
  - Slow and Fast Pointers (e.g., Linked List Cycle, Intersection of Two Linked Lists)

Stacks and Queues
  - Monotonic Stack (e.g., Daily Temperatures, Next Greater Element)
  - Queue and Deque Applications (e.g., Sliding Window Maximum)

Hashmaps and Sets
  - Basic Lookup Problems (e.g., Contains Duplicate, Intersection of Two Arrays)
  - Advanced Hashmap Problems (e.g., LRU Cache)


Trees and Graphs
  - Trees and Graphs
    - Traversals (e.g., Inorder Traversal, Binary Tree Level Order Traversal)
    - Tree Properties (e.g., Diameter of Binary Tree, Maximum Depth of Binary Tree)

Binary Search Trees
  - Basic BST Operations (e.g., Validate BST, Lowest Common Ancestor)
  - Modifications (e.g., Insert/Delete in BST)

Graphs
  - BFS/DFS Basics (e.g., Number of Islands, Flood Fill)
  - Topological Sort (e.g., Course Schedule)

Algorithms
  - Sorting and Searching
    - Binary Search (e.g., Search in Rotated Sorted Array, Median of Two Sorted Arrays)
    - Sorting Variations (e.g., Merge Intervals, K Closest Points to Origin)
    - Recursion

Dynamic Programming
  - 1D DP (e.g., Climbing Stairs, House Robber)
  - 2D DP (e.g., Unique Paths, Longest Common Subsequence)
  - Knapsack Problems (e.g., Partition Equal Subset Sum)

Greedy
  - Interval Problems (e.g., Non-Overlapping Intervals, Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons)
  - Path Problems (e.g., Jump Game, Gas Station)

Advanced Topics
  - Backtracking
    - Combinatorial Problems (e.g., Permutations, Subsets)
    - Constraint Problems (e.g., N-Queens, Sudoku Solver)

Bit Manipulation
  - Basic Operations (e.g., Single Number, Hamming Distance)
  - Advanced Techniques (e.g., Maximum XOR of Two Numbers)

Trie (Prefix Tree)
  - Basic Trie Problems (e.g., Implement Trie, Longest Word in Dictionary)
  - Advanced Problems (e.g., Word Search II)
